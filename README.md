## üìä Project Overview

This project provides an end-to-end Bank Customer Churn Analysis using a combination of SQL and Python. The analysis aims to identify key customer attributes influencing churn and to visualize important patterns that businesses can leverage to reduce customer attrition. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data aggregation using SQL queries, and predictive modeling with logistic regression. Visualizations are created to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders.

## üìÅ Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL queries)

- Python (Analysis, Visualization, EDA, Logistic Regression)

 ## Business Insights
Customer Segmentation: Customers segmented by city, age group, and number of accounts reveal different churn behaviors, allowing targeted retention strategies.

Churn Drivers: Logistic Regression identifies that higher account balance, being an active member, and having multiple accounts decrease churn risk, while other factors like age group and estimated salary have varied influence.

Visual Patterns: Scatterplots and bar charts visualize how average lifetime value and churn rates vary by geography and customer profiles, helping business leaders quickly spot at-risk segments.

Actionable Recommendations:

Focus on engaging younger and senior customers who show higher churn tendencies.

Promote account activity and encourage multiple account holdings.

Tailor retention programs city-wise based on churn patterns.
